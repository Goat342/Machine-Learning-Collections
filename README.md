# Machine-Learning-Collections
This will be a master collection of all creations we may produce, as both a landmark of accomplishments and a way to help/share with others. GitHub provides means to view and collaborate on projects from multiple devices. Your works don't have to be completed to drop them in here, feel free to add anything machine-learning related to this repository.

I am new to GitHub. 

Thanks for reading this.
