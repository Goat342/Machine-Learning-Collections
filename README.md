# Machine-Learning-Collections
This will be a master collection of all creations we may produce, as both a landmark of accomplishments and a way to help/share with others. GitHub provides means to view and collaborate on projects from multiple devices. Your works don't have to be completed to drop them in here, feel free to add anything machine-learning related to this repository.

From my understanding, the main branch is the official code for this repository and shouldn't be messed with. If you want to collaborate on this work you should edit another branch, such as the experimental branch, but I would currently ask that you just fork or download the files until I figure out exactly how that works.

Thanks for reading this.
